Sonus - Audio De-Clutter Utility
Version 1.0
------------------------------------------------------------------

TIRED OF THE CLUTTER?
You likely installed SteelSeries Sonar for the microphone features 
(ClearCast AI), not to have your Windows sound settings flooded with 
"Gaming," "Chat," "Media," and "Aux" channels.

Sonus solves this simple problem. It automatically disables the 
virtual playback devices you don't use, while keeping the 
microphone driver fully functional.

------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO INSTALL (Windows 10 / 11)
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Extract the folder to a safe place (like Documents or C:\Program Files\Sonus).
   *IMPORTANT: Keep 'Sonus.exe' and 'SoundVolumeView.exe' in the same folder.*

2. Run 'Sonus.exe'.

3. On the first run, it will ask if you want to run automatically 
   on Windows Startup. Click "Yes".

4. That's it! Sonus will now run silently in the background when you 
   turn on your PC.
